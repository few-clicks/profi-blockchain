# Employment Contract Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the Employment Contract smart contract. The smart contract is designed to manage the employment relationship between an employer and an employee, ensuring transparency and security in the agreement. It includes functionalities for contract creation, signing, payment, termination, and compliance reporting.

## Purpose

The Employment Contract smart contract aims to:
- Facilitate the creation and management of employment contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Ensure timely salary payments and other compensations.
- Provide mechanisms for contract termination with penalties.
- Allow employees to report non-compliance and ensure contract enforcement.

### report

```
function report() public onlyEmployee isContractSigned
```

- Description: Allows the employee to report non-compliance if the employer fails to make timely payments. The contract will be terminated, and the penalty will be transferred to the employee.
- Parameters: None.

## Usage

1. Contract Creation: The employer creates a contract by deploying the EmploymentContract with the necessary parameters.
2. Signing: The employer signs the contract and specifies the employee's address using signContract. The employee confirms their signature and deposits the penalty using confirmEmployeeSignature.
3. Payment: The employer makes periodic salary payments using makePayment.
4. Termination: Either party can terminate the contract using terminateContract. The penalty is transferred to the other party.
5. Reporting: The employee can report non-compliance using report, which checks for timely payments and terminates the contract if necessary.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Employment Contract smart contract, detailing its purpose, methods, and usage. By leveraging blockchain technology, the contract ensures transparency, security, and compliance in employment relationships.

# Truffle, Ganache, and Solidity: Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions on working with Truffle, Ganache, and Solidity for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 1. Introduction

Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum that provides tools for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. Solidity is the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 2. Setting Up the Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Install Truffle globally:

```
npm install -g truffle
```

2. Install Ganache:

- For Ganache CLI:

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

- For Ganache GUI, download and install from the [official website](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

## 3. Truffle Commands

### Project Initialization

#### truffle init

Initializes a new Truffle project with a basic directory structure.

```
truffle init
```

### Compilation

#### truffle compile

Compiles the smart contracts in the project.

```
truffle compile
```

### Migration

#### truffle migrate

Deploys the compiled contracts to the specified network.

```
truffle migrate
```

#### truffle migrate --reset

Re-deploys all contracts, even if they haven't changed.

```
truffle migrate --reset
```

### Testing

#### truffle test

Runs the tests for the smart contracts.

```
truffle test
```

### Interacting with Contracts

#### truffle console

Opens an interactive console to interact with deployed contracts.

```
truffle console
```

### Network Management

#### truffle develop

Starts a local development blockchain and opens a console.

```
truffle develop
```

#### truffle networks

Lists all configured networks.

```
truffle networks
```

### Truffle Console

#### truffle console

Opens an interactive console to interact with deployed contracts.

```
truffle console
```

Example usage in the console:

```
truffle(develop)> const instance = await MyContract.deployed()
truffle(develop)> const value = await instance.myFunction()
truffle(develop)> console.log(value)
```

## 4. Ganache

### Installation

- For Ganache CLI:

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

- For Ganache GUI, download and install from the [official website](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

### Configuration

Ganache can be configured to start with specific settings such as port, network ID, and accounts.

### Usage

#### Starting Ganache CLI

```
ganache-cli
```

#### Starting Ganache GUI

Open the Ganache application and click on "Quickstart" or configure a new workspace.

## 5. Network Configurations

### Local Network

Configure Truffle to use a local Ganache instance.

```
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*", // Match any network id
    },
  },
};
```

### Test Networks

Configure Truffle to use test networks like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or Kovan.

```
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    ropsten: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/${infuraKey}`),
      network_id: 3,       // Ropsten's id
      gas: 5500000,        // Ropsten has a lower block limit than mainnet
      confirmations: 2,    // # of confs to wait between deployments. (default: 0)
      timeoutBlocks: 200,  // # of blocks before a deployment times out  (minimum/default: 50)
      skipDryRun: true     // Skip dry run before migrations? (default: false for public nets )
    },
  },
};
```

### Mainnet

Configure Truffle to use the Ethereum mainnet.

```
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    mainnet: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${infuraKey}`),
      network_id: 1,       // Mainnet's id
      gas: 5500000,        // Mainnet has a higher block limit than testnets
      confirmations: 2,    // # of confs to wait between deployments. (default: 0)
      timeoutBlocks: 200,  // # of blocks before a deployment times out  (minimum/default: 50)
      skipDryRun: true     // Skip dry run before migrations? (default: false for public nets )
    },
  },
};
```

## 6. Solidity Overview

### Basics

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Example Contract

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

- Use the latest version of Solidity: Always use the latest stable version of Solidity to benefit from the latest features and security improvements.
- Follow naming conventions: Use camelCase for function and variable names, and PascalCase for contract names.
- Avoid using `tx.origin`: Use msg.sender instead of tx.origin for authorization checks.
- Use SafeMath: Use the SafeMath library to prevent integer overflow and underflow.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of working with Truffle, Ganache, and Solidity, including detailed explanations and examples of commands, network configurations, and best practices for Solidity development.
